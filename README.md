Was allowed 2 A4-sized double-paged handwritten/printed notes in 2023S2 exam. Struggled to make it. Hope they help when you need them. 

The content was mainly based on the pdf file I found online, which seemed to be upload in pre-pandemic time. I made modifications for they had different focuses and some variation in the content, I suggest you do the same according to what you were asked to do in your tutorials and assignments. 

The formatting includes font, font size, margins, line space, etc. Please refer to the actual settings in the file,  I followed some cheatsheet tutorial on youtube. Feel free to change whatever helps, personally I think Arial Narrow size 7.5 and 0.5cm margins work well enough . 

Don't print 10 mins before the exam, print at least 1 hr before and see how it looks like on actual papers so you have time to fix unforeseen weird shits caused by unforeseen stupid printer. Mark page number and keep in mind what is where. 

Anyway good luck.
